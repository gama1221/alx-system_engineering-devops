    Specifics About This Infrastructure
</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong> Server? </strong>.</li>
    <p> A server is a <i>powerful</i> computer hardware or software that provides different services to other computers, which are usually referred to as clients or users.
    </p>
    <li><strong>DNS </strong></li>
    <p>
       It is a naming system for computers, services, and other resources in the Internet or other Internet Protocol networks For example, the domain name                      www.ethiopianairlines.com is easier to recognize and remember than [23.12.103.180]. The IP address and domain name alias is mapped in the Domain Name System (DNS)
        The type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com.
        www.foobar.com uses an A record. This can be checked by running dig www.foobar.com.
        Note: the results might be different but for the infrastructure in this design, an A record is used.
        Address Mapping record (A Record)â€”also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.
